# mysql-employee-management-system

This project is a MySQL-based Employee Management System created for learning and portfolio purposes. It includes designing a database, creating tables, adding sample employee and department data, cleaning missing values, and performing analytical tasks to understand real-world database operations.

The database contains two tables:
1) employees – employee details such as ID, name, age, gender, department, salary, and joining date.
2) departments – department ID, department name, and location.

During the project, I practiced creating tables, inserting data, updating incorrect fields, deleting unnecessary rows, and handling NULL values. I also performed various analytical questions to understand employee distribution, salaries, departments, and joining patterns.

The analysis questions performed in this project include:
- Find all employee records
- Identify the employee with the highest salary
- Calculate the average salary for each department
- Count how many employees belong to each gender
- List employees who joined after 2020
- Find employees with salary between a certain range
- Count employees in each department
- Find employees above a certain age
- View employees only from the IT department

The project includes the full SQL database export, CSV files used for the dataset, and a file containing all executed SQL commands. This project demonstrates practical skills in MySQL, including database creation, data cleaning, table relationships, and handling basic to intermediate-level analytical questions.
